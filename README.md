# YT_Unblockr
This is an unblocker for YT, basically.
It's kind of amateur, but it works.
It's a site that changes a YouTube link you input to a https://www.youtube-nocookie.com link.
It then puts it the video in an iframe, with a dynamic anchor tag above that lets you view the video in fullscreen.
I can guarantee you this works vs. Relay, unless your school blocks youtube-nocookie.
